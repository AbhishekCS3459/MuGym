  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  votes     Vote[]
}

model Song {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  artist    String
  votes     Vote[]
}

model Gym {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  location  String
  songs     Song[]
}

model Vote {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
